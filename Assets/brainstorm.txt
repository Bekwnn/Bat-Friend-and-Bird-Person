THEME: Transmission

Immediate things that come to mind:
- radio
- video messages
- communication
- signals
- lost waves
- oscilloscope
- Journey online play (player "pings")
- networks
- couriers

- One idea: birds sing a series of notes. The player then has to communicate
  those notes back.
	- Platformer? Think geometry dash, platforming relates to the music.
	- Exploration game? The player explores a world (think FEZ) and has to
	  communicate with pings to interact with characters, the world,
	  solve challenges.
	- Bastion from overwatch? Communication between bird and character to
	  navigate a dark space. The player inputs to communicate to the bat,
	  and the bat replies a short while after.
		- Commands: Reveal, Fetch, Assist (double jump? glide?)
		- Environment elements activated by a sequence of noises (plays noises,
		  you repeat back to activate)

TODO:
basic platforming
noises and commands (bird/bat's reply is one note higher):
(do, RE, mi, FA, so, LA, ti, DO)
OR
bird/bat's reply is one octave higher
